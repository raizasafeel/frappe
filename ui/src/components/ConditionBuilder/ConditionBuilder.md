# ConditionBuilder

A nested tree of conditions joined by AND / OR — the control behind an
Assignment Rule's conditions, an SLA's, or any rule that needs `A and (B or C)`.
Grouping, conjunction toggling and add/remove belong to the component; the row is
a slot, so it fits doctype field conditions and domain-specific rules alike.

`Filter` is the flat, AND-only version of the same idea. Both read their
operator tables and value controls from the same modules, so they cannot drift.
See [ADR-0008](../../../docs/adr/0008-conditionbuilder-composes-filter-rules.md).

```ts
import { ConditionBuilder } from "@framework/ui/ConditionBuilder";
import type { ConditionGroup, FilterField } from "@framework/ui/ConditionBuilder";
```

An app that aliases the package to its source directory rather than resolving
`exports` imports `@framework/ui/components/ConditionBuilder`.

## Fields

Either give it a `doctype` and let it derive fields from Meta, as `Filter` does:

```vue
<ConditionBuilder v-model="conditions" doctype="ToDo" />
```

…or supply them yourself, in the same `FilterField` shape (`options` is Frappe's
newline-joined string):

```vue
<ConditionBuilder v-model="conditions" :fields="fields" />
```

`doctype` is read once at setup, so a host that switches doctype should remount
with `:key`. When the Meta request fails the component says so and offers a
retry, rather than presenting every row as though its field had been deleted.

## The model

```ts
{
  // one operator per gap: conjunctions[i] joins conditions[i] to conditions[i + 1]
  conjunctions: ["and", "or"],
  conditions: [
    { fieldname: "status", operator: "equals", value: "Open" },
    { fieldname: "subject", operator: "like", value: "refund" },
    {
      conjunctions: [],
      conditions: [{ fieldname: "priority", operator: "equals", value: "High" }],
    },
  ],
}
```

A group is anything with a `conjunctions` and a `conditions` array; everything
else is a leaf. The distinction is structural on purpose, so the tree survives a
JSON round-trip with no discriminator to keep in sync.

`conjunctions` always holds `conditions.length - 1` entries. A mixed level means
what Python means, since the array it compiles to is evaluated by `safe_eval`:
`and` binds tighter than `or`. Nest a group to override that.

`null` means an empty tree, not "uncontrolled" — a nullable backend field bound
straight to `v-model` arrives as `null`. Only leaving `modelValue` off entirely
makes it uncontrolled, in which case it keeps the tree itself.

### `conjunctionMode`

`"mixed"` (the default) gives every gap between two rows its own and/or, so one
level reads `A and B or C`. `"uniform"` gives the group a single operator: the
control is live on the second row only and locked on every row below it, and
changing it rewrites every gap in that group.

Storage is per-gap in both modes, so a tree authored in one is readable in the
other. A mixed tree opened in `uniform` keeps its operators until the first
toggle flattens them.

The operators sit on a rule drawn down the start edge of the group, so what a
chip joins is visible rather than inferred from the row it happens to sit on.
Every row shows its operator, including the row a nested group's card sits in —
a card with nothing in that cell reads as unattached. What `uniform` changes is
how many of them are controls: the second row holds the one that rewrites the
group, and the rows below render the word as text rather than as a disabled copy
of the same button.

### `conjunctionPlacement`

`"row"` (the default) is the above: the operator sits in the row it joins, on the
rule down the group. `"header"` puts one control at the top of each group
instead — a segmented and/or beside that group's add buttons — and takes the
leading cell out of every row, so a row holds nothing but its condition.

A header shows one operator for the whole group, so it implies the `uniform`
model whatever `conjunctionMode` says: setting it writes every gap. A tree whose
gaps disagree shows neither segment until the control is used, which then settles
them. The `#where` and `#conjunction` slots have no cell to replace under a
header and are not rendered; `#addCondition` moves up into it.

## Reordering

Rows can be dragged within their group by the handle beside the operator, which
announces where the row came from and where it landed. `reorderable: false` turns
the handles off.

Dragging is the only built-in path, so it is pointer-only. `#actions` is handed
`moveUp` / `moveDown` and their guards, so a host that needs a keyboard path puts
its own items in that menu; they run the same edit and announce the same
sentence.

A move never reparents: a row cannot leave the group it is in, and dropping one
on a nested group's card does not put it inside. Grouping stays an explicit
`Turn into a Group` / `Add Condition Group`, so a drag can never silently change
what a rule means — only the order it reads in.

The operator travels with the row that displayed it, which is the rule a removal
already follows. Moving `C` to the top of `A and B or C` gives `C or A and B`:
the word `C` showed is now above `A`. In `uniform` every gap holds the same
operator, so a move cannot change the rule at all.

## Operators

Reading is wider than writing: the reader accepts every operator the stored
format can hold, and a leaf keeps a stored operator in its own dropdown even
when the field's own operator list would not offer it today — a saved rule is
always legible, and is only rewritten deliberately.

Writing is narrower than `Filter`'s list. `is not` is offered because the host's
compiler implements it; `timespan` is withheld because the host's compiler has
no rule for it and would emit an expression that raises whenever the rule runs.

## Persisting

Frappe's Assignment Rule and SLA condition fields store an array that interleaves
conjunctions between conditions. Convert at the persistence boundary:

```ts
import {
  fromFrappeConditions,
  toFrappeConditions,
} from "@framework/ui/ConditionBuilder";

const tree = fromFrappeConditions(JSON.parse(doc.assign_condition_json || "[]"));
doc.assign_condition_json = JSON.stringify(toFrappeConditions(tree));
```

A level that mixes `and` and `or` stays flat and stays mixed, one token per gap.
An entry that cannot be parsed — an unknown operator, a doctype-qualified filter,
a stray `null`, number or token between two filters — is preserved verbatim and
rendered non-editable, so such a record round-trips byte-identical instead of
being deleted by the next save. Separator tokens are matched case-insensitively
for the same reason.

Two things are dropped rather than written: an empty group, and a row the user
added but never gave a field to. Both are lossless — neither holds a condition —
and both would otherwise be written as an entry the host's compiler cannot
destructure into a field, an operator and a value.

A stored `==`, `=` or `!=` is read as an alias and re-saved in this component's
vocabulary. No migration is needed: the host's compiler maps `equals`, `=` and
`==` onto the same `==`, so the compiled expression does not change.

## Slots

| Slot | Replaces |
| --- | --- |
| `#condition` | the whole row, for a leaf of your own shape |
| `#value` | only the value control inside the built-in row |
| `#where` / `#conjunction` | the leading cell of a row |
| `#actions` | the row's overflow menu |
| `#addCondition` | a group's add affordance |
| `#empty` | the empty state's content |

Supplying an empty template removes that furniture entirely.

## Props worth knowing

| Prop | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `conjunctionMode` | `mixed` / `uniform` — an operator per gap, or per group |
| `conjunctionPlacement` | `row` / `header` — the and/or in each row, or atop the group |
| `columns` | the three cells' grid track sizes |
| `maxDepth` | how deep nesting is offered (default 4) |
| `modalDepth` | where nesting escapes into a dialog (default 2) |
| `bordered` | `all` / `root` / `none` — which groups draw a card |
| `newCondition` | factory for a new leaf, when `#condition` is used |
| `labels` | every string it renders, for `__()` |
| `disabled` | blocks *adding*; existing rows stay editable |
| `readonly` | nothing is editable; the tree renders as text |
| `reorderable` | whether rows can be dragged or moved (default true) |

`disabled` is for a form failing validation: no new conditions, but the ones
there can still be fixed or removed. `readonly` shows a rule you are not editing.

## Accessibility

- A group is a `<fieldset>` at the root and `role="group"` nested, named from its
  own conjunction — nested `<legend>`s are read before every control, and a
  fixed name would state the opposite the moment the conjunction is toggled.
- Rows are a real list, so position is announced without a name to keep in sync.
- Every control is named by `aria-labelledby` against the row's field, so eight
  operator selects are told apart ("Status, operator"). Attribute fallthrough is
  not used: `Button` overwrites `aria-label` from `label`, and `Combobox` never
  passes attrs to its trigger.
- Removing a row moves focus to the row that took its place, and announces the
  count — plus the cascade, when the group went with it.
- The drag handle is `aria-hidden`: it duplicates no control and names nothing.
  **Reordering has no built-in keyboard path** — a known gap, and the reason
  `#actions` is handed `moveUp` / `moveDown`. Where a host adds them, the move
  announces both positions (a position alone means nothing to someone who did not
  watch it move) and returns focus to the menu it was run from.
- `readonly` renders text rather than disabled controls: a disabled control is
  skipped in a screen reader's forms mode and is exempt from the contrast
  minimum, which would make a read-only tree unreadable.

Known gap: the date and rating value controls drop attributes, so their cell
carries the name instead of the control. Fixing that needs an `aria-labelledby`
passthrough on the shared `Fields` components and frappe-ui's `DateRangePicker`.
