  ConditionBuilder — a controlled editor for a nested and/or condition tree. Its
  `v-model` is the tree; it owns no data resource and never calls an app endpoint
  (FP2). The built-in leaf's fields come from the doctype's Meta (FP3) or from an
  explicit `fields` array. It also owns the two singular things: the live region,
  mounted once and unconditionally, and focus.
